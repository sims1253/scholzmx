  abstract = {The author developed in 1976 the sinepower probability density function (SP-PDF) to fit up random processes which are bounded at the lower and upper ends, and which has a mode occurring between these two bounds. This latter condition is now relaxed and a generalized PDF entitled double bounded probability density function (DB-PDF) is developed here. Methods for the application to practical problems of parameter estimation and to computer simulation of random variables are explained by a numerical example.},

  abstract = {The Kumaraswamy distribution is very similar to the Beta distribution but has the key advantage of a closed-form cumulative distribution function. This makes it much better suited than the Beta distribution for computation-intensive activities like simulation modeling and the estimation of models by simulation-based methods. However, in spite of the fact that the Kumaraswamy distribution was introduced in 1980, further theoretical research on the distribution was not developed until very recently (Garg, 2008; Jones, 2009; Mitnik, 2009; Nadarajah, 2008). This article contributes to this recent research and: (a) shows that Kumaraswamy variables exhibit closeness under exponentiation and under linear transformation; (b) derives an expression for the moments of the general form of the distribution; (c) specifies some of the distribution's limiting distributions; and (d) introduces an analytical expression for the mean absolute deviation around the median as a function of the parameters of the distribution, and establishes some bounds for this dispersion measure and for the variance.},
