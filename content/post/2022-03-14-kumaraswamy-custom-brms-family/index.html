<p><em>Update:</em> We finally published <a href="https://github.com/sims1253/bayesfam">bayesim</a>,
a package that contains a bunch of custom families for brms.</p>
<p>I am currently working with different unit interval distributions and one of the
more common ones to be mentioned in the literature is the Kumaraswamy distribution
<span class="citation">Kumaraswamy (<a href="#ref-kumaraswamyGeneralizedProbabilityDensity1980" role="doc-biblioref">1980</a>)</span>.
As I am working with brms and there is no built-in family for the kumaraswamy distribution,
I had to write a custom family for it. This blog post is a documentation of my
process and could serve as a kind of tutorial I guess.
I am roughly following the
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/vignettes/brms_customfamilies.html">brms custom family vignette here</a>,
in case you want to take a look at it.</p>
<p>Before any code, let’s collect all the necessary information
about the Kumaraswamy distribution. I took these from <span class="citation">Mitnik (<a href="#ref-mitnikNewPropertiesKumaraswamy2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The probability density function for the unit interval is given as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f_x(x) = pqx^{(p-1)}(1-x^p)^{(q-1)}, 0&lt;x&lt;1, p &gt; 0, q &gt; 0
\]</span></p>
<p>Now in brms I would like to have a mean parametrization for that density. Sadly,
the mean is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
E(X) = qB(1 + \frac{1}{p}, q)
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is the beta function, which can not be inverted to solve for p or q.
However, the quantile function is available in closed-form:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
x = [1-(1-u)^{\frac{1}{q}}]^\frac{1}{p}, 0&lt;u&lt;1
\]</span></p>
<p>The median can be derived from the quantile function and results in a
formula that can be solved for q:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
md(X) = w = (1-0.5^\frac{1}{q})^\frac{1}{p}
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
q = -\frac{log(2)}{log(1-w^p)}
\]</span></p>
<div id="median-parametrization" class="section level2">
<h2>Median Parametrization</h2>
<p>To build the median parametrization I first wrote a function for the given pdf
and then replaced each occurrence of q with the result from the last section.
While there is room to improve, this is just a first draft.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>median_dkumaraswamy &lt;- function(x, md, p){
  p*(-(log(2)/log(1-md^p)))*x^(p-1)*(1-x^p)^((-(log(2)/log(1-md^p)))-1)
}</code></pre>
<p>Let’s see if the density looks as it should with a symmetric, an asymmetric and
a bathtub shape.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x=seq(from=0 , to=1 , length.out=10000)[2:9999] # exclude 0 and 1

layout(matrix(1:3, ncol = 3))
plot(x, median_dkumaraswamy(x, md = 0.5, p = 4), type=&quot;l&quot;, ylab = &quot;Density&quot;, main = &quot;Symmetric Kumaraswamy&quot;)
plot(x, median_dkumaraswamy(x, md = 0.75, p = 4), type=&quot;l&quot;, ylab = &quot;Density&quot;, main = &quot;Asymmetric Kumaraswamy&quot;)
plot(x, median_dkumaraswamy(x, md = 0.5, p = 0.25), type=&quot;l&quot;, ylab = &quot;Density&quot;, main = &quot;Bathtub Kumaraswamy&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/median-test-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>And while this might not be possible for every distribution, chances are high
that someone else already wrote a density you could check against.
In the case of the kumaraswamy distribution, I was lucky.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>layout(matrix(1:3, ncol = 3))
plot(x, median_dkumaraswamy(x, 0.5, 4) - extraDistr::dkumar(x,4, -log(2)/log(1-0.5^4)), ylab = &quot;Difference&quot;, main = &quot;Symmetric: Mine - extraDistr&quot;)
plot(x, median_dkumaraswamy(x, 0.75, 4) - extraDistr::dkumar(x,4, -log(2)/log(1-0.75^4)), ylab = &quot;Difference&quot;, main = &quot;Asymmetric: Mine - extraDistr&quot;)
plot(x, median_dkumaraswamy(x, 0.5, 0.25) - extraDistr::dkumar(x,0.25 , -log(2)/log(1-0.5^0.25)), ylab = &quot;Difference&quot;, main = &quot;Bathtub: Mine - extraDistr&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/median-test-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>And it seems as if all is well here.</p>
<p>Now you might be asking why I would want to write my own density function if
there already was one.
The answer is that I have to write stan code for the log-pdf for the custom
family and before I do that, I want to have a working version in R that I can test.
And all this is also an exercise in case I need to write one of these without a
preexisting implementation.</p>
</div>
<div id="log-density-function" class="section level2">
<h2>Log-Density-Function</h2>
<p>While writing my own proper density function, I have to keep in mind, that stan
uses the log-pdf as it is a lot more numerically robust, so I shall do the same
for the R version of my code.</p>
<p>To make this work well, I can’t just wrap the density function in a <code>log</code>
Instead, I have to use the rules for logarithms like <span class="math inline">\(log(x^r) = rlog(x)\)</span> and
composite functions like <code>log1p</code> to get the most out of the transformation.
In case I’d want the density on the natural scale, I just throw an <code>exp</code> on the
result.
Add some input checks and the results looks like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dkumaraswamy &lt;- function(x, mu, p, log = FALSE) {
  if (isTRUE(any(x &lt;= 0 || x &gt;= 1))) {
    stop(&quot;x must be in (0,1).&quot;)
  }
  if (isTRUE(mu &lt;= 0 || mu &gt;= 1)) {
    stop(&quot;The median must be in (0,1).&quot;)
  }
  if (isTRUE(p &lt;= 0)) {
    stop(&quot;P must be above 0.&quot;)
  }
  lpdf &lt;- log(p) +
    log(log(2)) -
    log(-(log1p(-mu^p))) +
    (p - 1) * log(x) +
    ((-(log(2) / log1p(-mu^p))) - 1) * log1p(-x^p)

  if (log) {
    return(lpdf)
  } else {
    return(exp(lpdf))
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>I compare this to the implementation from earlier to test for implementation problems
again and can see that the differences are on the float resolution scale, which
is what I would expect as the difference between just wrapping in <code>log()</code>
and further optimizing the code.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>layout(matrix(1:3, ncol = 3))

md = 0.5
p = 4
plot(log(median_dkumaraswamy(x, md, p))-dkumaraswamy(x, md, p, log = TRUE), ylab = &quot;Difference&quot;, main = &quot;Symmetric: Simple log - Advanced log&quot;)

md = 0.75
plot(log(median_dkumaraswamy(x, md, p))-dkumaraswamy(x, md, p, log = TRUE), ylab = &quot;Difference&quot;, main = &quot;Asymmetric: Simple log - Advanced log&quot;)

md = 0.5
p = 0.25
plot(log(median_dkumaraswamy(x, md, p))-dkumaraswamy(x, md, p, log = TRUE), ylab = &quot;Difference&quot;, main = &quot;Bathtub: Simple log - Advanced log&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/log-density-test-1.png" width="672" /></p>
</div>
<div id="rng" class="section level2">
<h2>RNG</h2>
<p>Now, while this is not necessary to fit models with the kumaraswamy distribution,
I needed an rng anyways, so I figured, I could just add the code here for a quick
showcase of the inverse cdf method of building an rng.
The inverse cdf method uses the fact that there is simple quantile- or
cumulative density function that can be used to transform a uniform random variable
to a kumaraswamy distributed one.
As a reminder, that is the same function we used to derive the median, which is simply
the 50th percentile.
Essentially we randomly point at a quantile and ask the quantile function, what number it corresponds to.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rkumaraswamy &lt;- function(n, mu, p){
  if (isTRUE(any(md &lt;= 0 || mu &gt;= 1))) {
    stop(&quot;The median must be in (0,1).&quot;)
  }
  if (isTRUE(p &lt;= 0)) {
    stop(&quot;P must be above 0.&quot;)
  }
  q = -(log(2)/log1p(-mu^p))
  return(
    (1-(1-runif(n, min=0, max=1))^(1/q))^(1/p)
  )
}</code></pre>
<p>To test the RNG, I generate three samples, as before, and see if it
recovers the median and passes a visual check to match the form I would expect.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>layout(matrix(1:3, ncol = 3))
y = rkumaraswamy(10000, mu = 0.5, p = 4)
hist(y, main = paste(&quot;Median:&quot;, median(y)))

y = rkumaraswamy(10000, mu = 0.75, p = 4)
hist(y, main = paste(&quot;Median:&quot;, median(y)))

y = rkumaraswamy(10000, mu = 0.5, p = 0.25)
hist(y, main = paste(&quot;Median:&quot;, median(y)))</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/rng-test-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>In all three cases, both the distribution and median look like I’d like them to.</p>
</div>
<div id="post-processing" class="section level2">
<h2>Post-Processing</h2>
<p>Before I can start writing the complete family, I also want to add support
for all the cool post-processing things brms supports, like calculating the log
likelihood of an observation, as needed for elpd based <code>loo</code> calculations.
This can be built from the log pdf, the posterior samples and observation provided by brms.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>log_lik_kumaraswamy &lt;- function(i, prep) {
  mu &lt;- get_dpar(prep, &quot;mu&quot;, i = i)
  p &lt;- get_dpar(prep, &quot;p&quot;, i = i)
  y &lt;- prep$data$Y[i]
  return(dkumaraswamy(y, mu, p, log = TRUE))
}</code></pre>
<p>The second post-processing step I’d like to support is the <code>posterior_predict</code>
function, as used by posterior predictive plots for rough model misspecification.
Here I just generate random numbers using the parameters provided by brms.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>posterior_predict_kumaraswamy &lt;- function(i, prep, ...) {
  mu &lt;- get_dpar(prep, &quot;mu&quot;, i = i)
  p &lt;- get_dpar(prep, &quot;p&quot;, i = i)
  return(rkumaraswamy(prep$ndraws, mu, p))
}</code></pre>
<p>The last step of post processing that is part of the custom family vignette is
the <code>posterior_epred</code> function, used for example for conditional effects.
This requires the calculation of the posterior mean. Luckily I already have an
equation for the mean, so I can just recover q as done in the intro and plug p and
q into the equation for the mean.
All done again with the parameters supplied by brms.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>posterior_epred_kumaraswamy &lt;- function(prep) {
  mu &lt;- get_dpar(prep, &quot;mu&quot;)
  p &lt;- get_dpar(prep, &quot;p&quot;)
  q &lt;- -(log(2) / log1p(-mu^p))
  return(q * beta((1 + 1 / p), q))
}</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="custom-family" class="section level2">
<h2>Custom Family</h2>
<p>And with all that out of the way, it is time to built the actual custom family.
I wrapped the <code>custom_family</code> call so I could set the link function that I
wanted and add the stanvars to the family object, to make it self contained.</p>
<p>The stanvars contain the stan code for the lpdf and rng, which is mostly a simple
copy of the R code with some small adjustments when built in functions of R and
stan differ, such as the use of <code>log1m(x)</code> in stan instead of <code>log1p(-x)</code> in R.</p>
<p>The rest of the function is naming of the parameters, setting links on them,
defining lower and upper bounds, the scale of the distribution and adding the
post processing functions from above.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>kumaraswamy &lt;- function(link = &quot;logit&quot;, link_p = &quot;log&quot;) {
  family &lt;- brms::custom_family(
    &quot;kumaraswamy&quot;,
    dpars = c(&quot;mu&quot;, &quot;p&quot;),
    links = c(link, link_p),
    lb = c(0, 0),
    ub = c(1, NA),
    type = &quot;real&quot;,
    log_lik = log_lik_kumaraswamy,
    posterior_predict = posterior_predict_kumaraswamy,
    posterior_epred = posterior_epred_kumaraswamy
  )
  family$stanvars &lt;- brms::stanvar(
    scode = &quot;
      real kumaraswamy_lpdf(real y, real mu, real p) {
         return  (log(p) + log(log(2)) - log(-(log1m(mu^p))) + (p-1) * log(y) +
                 ((-(log(2)/log1m(mu^p)))-1) * log1m(y^p));
      }

      real kumaraswamy_rng(real mu, real p) {
         return ((1-(1-uniform_rng(0, 1))^(1/(-(log(2)/log1m(mu^p)))))^(1/p));
      }&quot;,
    block = &quot;functions&quot;
  )
  return(family)
}</code></pre>
<p>And with that, the custom family is done.</p>
</div>
<div id="brms-fitting" class="section level2">
<h2>brms fitting</h2>
<p>Before leaving, I should obviously show you that it actually works.
So here is a quick example where I generate a dataset, fit a kumaraswamy model
to it and run some of the post processing I prepared for:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>a = rnorm(1000)
data = list(a = a, y = rkumaraswamy(1000, inv_logit_scaled(0.2 + 0.5 * a), 4))
hist(data$y)</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/brms-kumaraswamy-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>fit1 &lt;- brm(
  y ~ 1 + a,
  data = data, 
  family = kumaraswamy(),
  stanvars = kumaraswamy()$stanvars,
  backend = &quot;cmdstan&quot;
)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(fit1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  Family: kumaraswamy 
##   Links: mu = logit; p = identity 
## Formula: y ~ 1 + a 
##    Data: data (Number of observations: 1000)

<pre class="r"><code>plot(fit1)</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/brms-kumaraswamy-3-1.png" width="672" />
The summary shows that the model is sampling well and can recover the parameters.
There are also no sampling problems to see in the Rhat, ESS and trace plot.
Wonderfull.
So how about a posterior predictive check anyone? Wouldn’t that be something?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>brms::pp_check(fit1)</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/pp-check-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>I would say that looks quite fine. But how about those conditional effects?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>brms::conditional_effects(fit1)</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/conditional-effects-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>That also looks like I would expect it to.</p>
<p>Finally, lets calculate the loo-elpd for the fit and compare it to one using a
beta likelihood:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>loo_kumaraswamy &lt;- loo::loo(fit1)
loo_kumaraswamy</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
## Computed from 4000 by 1000 log-likelihood matrix
## 
##          Estimate   SE
## elpd_loo    575.2 20.0
## p_loo         2.7  0.2
## looic     -1150.4 40.1
## ------
## Monte Carlo SE of elpd_loo is 0.0.
## 
## All Pareto k estimates are good (k &lt; 0.5).
## See help(&#39;pareto-k-diagnostic&#39;) for details.</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>fit2 &lt;- brm(
  y ~ 1 + a,
  data = data,
  family = Beta(),
  backend = &quot;cmdstan&quot;
)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>loo::loo_compare(loo_kumaraswamy, loo(fit2))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##      elpd_diff se_diff
## fit1   0.0       0.0  
## fit2 -47.1       8.6</code></pre>
<p>Nice. To nobodies surprise, the kumaraswamy fit had better predictive performance
than the beta fit hehe.</p>
<p>And that’s it. At this point the custom family is ready to use and supports
all the good things brms comes with.</p>
