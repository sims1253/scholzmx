  abstract = {Many students of statistics and econometrics express frustration with the way a problem known as ``bad control'' is treated in the traditional literature. The issue arises when the addition of a variable to a regression equation produces an unintended discrepancy between the regression coefficient and the effect that the coefficient is expected to represent. Avoiding such discrepancies presents a challenge to all analysts in the data intensive sciences. This note describes graphical tools for understanding, visualizing, and resolving the problem through a series of illustrative examples. We have found that the cases presented here can serve as a powerful instructional device to supplement more extended and formal discussions of the problem. By making this ``crash course'' accessible to instructors and practitioners, we hope to avail these tools to a broader community of scientists concerned with the causal interpretation of regression models.},
