## Equipment

- Kitchen scale
- Timer
- Pour-over dripper (V60, Chemex, or similar)
- Gooseneck kettle
- Coffee grinder
- Small notebook (optional but helpful)

## The Recipe

**Ratio:** 1:16 (15g coffee to 240g water)
**Water temp:** Just off boiling (let it sit 30 seconds)
**Grind:** Medium-fine
**Time:** About 4 minutes total

### Steps

1. **Weigh coffee** - 15g of beans. Grind them.

2. **Heat water** - Boil, then let cool for 30 seconds.

3. **Bloom** (0:00-0:30) - Pour 30g water over grounds. They'll puff up and bubble.

4. **First pour** (0:30-1:30) - Slowly add water in circles until you hit 150g total.

5. **Final pour** (1:30-2:30) - Pour the rest to reach 240g.

6. **Wait** (2:30-4:00) - Let it finish dripping.

## Tracking (Optional)

If you want to improve over time, keep notes:

- Date
- Bean type and roast date
- Grind setting
- Total brew time
- How it tasted (good/okay/bad)

After a few weeks you'll notice patterns. Maybe setting 14 on your grinder works better than 15. Maybe beans are best 7-10 days after roasting.

## Tips

**Use the scale** - Weight is more accurate than volume. A cheap kitchen scale beats eyeballing every time.

**Don't rush** - Good coffee takes 4 minutes. That's just how long it takes.

**Consistency beats perfection** - Same process every time will get you better results than trying to optimize each variable.
