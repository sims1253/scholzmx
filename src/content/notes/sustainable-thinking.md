How do we think in ways that compound rather than deplete?

## Unsustainable Thinking Patterns

- Reactive analysis without reflection
- Consuming information without integration
- Seeking quick answers over deep understanding
- Optimizing for output over insight

## Sustainable Alternatives

**Deep Work Cycles**

- Protected time for sustained attention
- Regular breaks for subconscious processing
- Seasonal rhythms of intense work and rest

**Knowledge Composting**

- Let failed ideas decompose into wisdom
- Regularly revisit and connect old thoughts
- Transform confusion into fertilizer for new growth

**Intellectual Permaculture**

- Design thinking systems that regenerate energy
- Create thought patterns that feed each other
- Build resilience through cognitive diversity

_The goal is thinking that gets better with age, like a well-tended garden or a good wine._
