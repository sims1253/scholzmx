Digital gardens are fundamentally different from blogs. Where blogs are performative - polished pieces meant for consumption - gardens are exploratory. They're spaces where ideas can be planted as seeds and tended over time.

## The Garden Metaphor

Just as a physical garden has:

- **Seeds** (new ideas, barely formed thoughts)
- **Saplings** (concepts taking shape)
- **Mature plants** (well-developed ideas)
- **Compost** (failed experiments that feed new growth)

A digital garden should embrace this natural progression. Not everything needs to be publication-ready.

## Connected Growth

Ideas don't grow in isolation. They cross-pollinate, share nutrients, create symbiotic relationships. The magic happens in the connections between thoughts.
