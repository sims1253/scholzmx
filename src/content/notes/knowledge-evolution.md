Traditional publishing assumes knowledge is static - you research, write, publish, done. But that's not how understanding actually works.

## Real Learning is Iterative

Ideas improve through:

- **Exposure** - sharing half-formed thoughts
- **Feedback** - hearing how others interpret your ideas
- **Reflection** - revisiting concepts with fresh perspective
- **Connection** - linking to new contexts

## The Power of "Work in Progress"

Publishing work-in-progress thoughts:

- Invites collaboration and correction
- Reduces pressure to be "perfect"
- Documents the journey, not just destinations
- Creates accountability for continued learning

_This is why version control for thoughts matters. Ideas aren't commits - they're living branches._

The [[digital-gardens-philosophy]] embraces this naturally - gardens are never "finished".
