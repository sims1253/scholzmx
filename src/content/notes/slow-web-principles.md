The web doesn't have to be fast food. It can be a home-cooked meal.

## Core Principles

**Sustainability over Speed**

- Optimize for human attention, not algorithms
- Build sites that last years, not months
- Consider environmental impact of digital choices

**Quality over Quantity**

- Better to write one thoughtful piece than ten rushed posts
- Depth over breadth in every interaction
- Curate, don't just accumulate

**Connection over Consumption**

- Foster genuine engagement
- Create spaces for reflection
- Enable serendipitous discovery

_The goal isn't to capture attention, but to deserve it._

This philosophy directly influences how I think about [[digital-gardens-philosophy]] - they're naturally aligned with slow web principles.
