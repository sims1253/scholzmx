title: "Photography"
---

As a researcher and academic, I use photography to document my journey through the world of computational science and beyond. These images capture moments from my research travels, conference presentations, and the everyday life of a PhD student. Each photograph tells a story of discovery, collaboration, and the pursuit of understanding complex systems.
