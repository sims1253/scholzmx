# Digital Garden Website Template

A thoughtful, privacy-first website built with **slow web principles** and a warm, botanical aesthetic. This is both a personal digital garden and a template for others who want to create their own mindful spaces on the internet.

## 🌱 Philosophy

This website embodies:
- **Slow web principles**: No tracking, no analytics, no dark patterns
- **Digital garden thinking**: Ideas that grow and evolve naturally
- **Seasonal rhythms**: Content that follows natural cycles  
- **Community over commerce**: Connection, not conversion
- **Privacy by design**: Respects visitors without surveillance
- **Accessibility first**: Works for everyone, on any device
- **Minimal dependencies**: Fast, lightweight, and sustainable

## 🎨 Aesthetic

Inspired by:
- Illuminated manuscripts and medieval marginalia
- Late-summer botanical illustrations  
- The cozy warmth of hand-textured papers
- Simon Sarris and TurnTrout's thoughtful web design
- The nostalgic UI of classic games like Stronghold
