**A discrete color palette generator with support for fixed colors optimized for both normal and color vision deficient viewers.**

[{{< fa code >}} GitHub](https://github.com/sims1253/huerd) | [{{< fa book >}} Documentation](https://github.com/sims1253/huerd#readme) | [{{< fa download >}} Install](https://github.com/sims1253/huerd#installation)

The huerd package (short for "Herding hues") provides sophisticated tools for creating perceptually distinct color palettes optimized for accessibility and visual appeal. Unlike standard color palette generators, huerd works in the perceptually uniform OKLAB color space and includes comprehensive support for color vision deficiency analysis.

**Key Features:**
- Generate palettes of any size with customizable parameters
- Include specific "fixed" colors during palette generation
- Comprehensive diagnostic tools for palette quality analysis
- Color vision deficiency (CVD) accessibility checks and simulations
- Perceptual color distance optimization

**Technical Approach:**
The package uses constrained optimization in the OKLAB color space to maximize perceptual distinctness while maintaining aesthetic coherence. It includes built-in CVD simulation using the colorspace package and provides detailed quality metrics for each generated palette.

**A comprehensive framework for Bayesian statistical modeling with focus on making advanced statistical methods accessible to researchers across different domains.**

[{{< fa code >}} GitHub](https://github.com/scholzmx) | [{{< fa flask >}} Research](../research.qmd)

BayeSim is an ongoing research project developing novel Bayesian statistical methods for complex computational problems in scientific computing. The framework focuses on uncertainty quantification, model selection, and robust inference in high-dimensional parameter spaces.

**Current Development:**
- Automated model selection algorithms
- Causal inference tools for observational data
- Scalable MCMC implementations
- Integration with popular scientific computing workflows

**Research Goals:**
Provide researchers with practical tools for making reliable decisions under uncertainty, particularly in simulation-based sciences where traditional statistical approaches may fall short. The framework emphasizes reproducibility, accessibility, and robust statistical inference.
