I am developing novel Bayesian statistical methods for complex computational problems in scientific computing. This research focuses on uncertainty quantification, model selection, and robust inference in high-dimensional parameter spaces. My work aims to provide researchers with practical tools for making reliable decisions under uncertainty, particularly in simulation-based sciences where traditional statistical approaches may fall short.

I am working on developing robust software infrastructure that supports reproducible scientific research. This includes creating tools for workflow management, data validation, and automated testing in computational science applications. My goal is to make scientific computing more reliable, accessible, and maintainable for researchers across different domains.
