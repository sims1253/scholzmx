I am a PhD researcher at the University of Stuttgart, Cluster of Excellence SimTech, working at the intersection of Bayesian statistics, computational science, and software engineering.

My research focuses on developing robust statistical methods and computational tools for complex scientific problems. I'm particularly interested in making statistical methods more accessible and reliable for researchers across different domains.

My academic background includes a Bachelor's in Computational Science from Hamburg University of Technology and a Master's in Software Engineering from Chalmers University of Technology.

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:scholzmxb@gmail.com) if you have questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
