    "text": "This document outlines the plan for rebuilding the personal and professional website for Max Scholz (scholzmx.com). The primary goal is to create a visually distinct, content-focused, and highly personal website that serves as a hub for professional information, research, and personal blogging.\nThe new site will be built using Quarto, leveraging its powerful code-rendering capabilities while applying a completely custom theme to achieve a unique aesthetic.\n\n\n\n\nContent-First: The design must prioritize readability and put the user’s written content at the forefront.\nEmbrace the Slow Web: The site should be designed for longevity, not urgency. This means focusing on durable content, simple and robust technology, and a calm, intentional user experience. It is a rejection of the ephemeral, attention-grabbing trends of the modern web.\nTufte-Inspired Clarity: The design will draw inspiration from Edward Tufte’s principles of information design, emphasizing clarity, data-ink ratio, and avoiding unnecessary decoration.\n“Paper-y” Aesthetic: The visual theme should evoke the feeling of reading on high-quality paper—warm, comfortable, and classic.\nAccessibility First (No-JS Core): All core content and navigation must be perfectly functional and readable with JavaScript disabled.\nProgressive Enhancement: Interactive elements will be layered on top using non-essential JavaScript.\nPersonal Touch: The site should feel unique, incorporating elements like the author’s mother’s artwork.\nDesktop First, Mobile Responsive: The primary design target is a desktop view, but the layout must be fully responsive.\nPrivacy-Focused: No tracking or third-party dependencies from large corporations (e.g., Google Fonts).\n\n\n\n\n\nEngine: Quarto\nStyling: Custom SCSS theme with privacy-friendly fonts (Bunny Fonts).\nInteractivity: Minimal, vanilla JavaScript for progressive enhancements.\nHosting: GitHub Pages with a GitHub Actions workflow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsimonsarris.com: Model for the minimalist, single-column layout, clean header navigation, and overall focus on readable content.\ngwern.net / turntrout.com: Inspiration for future-state advanced hosting (caching, archival) and deep, interconnected content.\nputanumonit.com / mailchi.mp/btiscience/ferns: Inspiration for the “paper-y” feel, warm color palettes, and classic typography.\nEdward Tufte: The work of Edward Tufte will inform the site’s commitment to data visualization, clarity, and information density.\n\n\n\n\n\nMain Layout: A single, centered content column with generous whitespace. Max width of 800px.\nHeader: Simple header with “Max Scholz” on the left and navigation links (Blog, Research, About, CV) on the right.\nFooter: Minimal footer with copyright, CC license, and social/professional links.\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground: Warm, off-white, paper-like color (e.g., #fdfbf6).\nText: Dark, soft gray/black (e.g., #333333).\nAccent Color: Muted, earthy tone for links (e.g., a deep green or terracotta).\n\n\n\n\n\nFont Source: Bunny Fonts (GDPR-compliant Google Fonts alternative).\nBody Text: A classic, readable serif font (e.g., “Lora” or “Source Serif Pro”).\nHeadings: A clean, complementary sans-serif font (e.g., “Lato” or “Source Sans Pro”).\nAccent Handwriting: Sparingly use a highly readable handwriting font (e.g., from Bunny Fonts) for non-essential, personal touches like a signature. This adds personality without compromising the readability of core content.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Content is unchanged from previous version)\n\n\n\nThis roadmap is broken into atomic commits.

This would be a significant step towards a more academic and information-rich presentation, especially for research articles and would align the website more with the core ideas of Tufte.\nEvolve into a Digital Garden: Move beyond a traditional blog structure towards a network of interconnected notes. This involves:\n\nCreating a dedicated /garden section for evergreen notes, ideas, and summaries.\nPrioritizing bidirectional linking between pages to create a web of knowledge.\nWriting in a way that notes can be updated over time as understanding evolves.\nLeveraging Quarto’s built-in cross-referencing (@page-title) as a foundation and potentially exploring more advanced solutions for visualizing the network.\n\nIllustrated Manuscript Initials: Replace the CSS-based drop caps with a system that uses images of ornate, manuscript-style first letters. This could involve a small script to replace the first letter with an &lt;img&gt; tag pointing to a random initial from a collection. This could also be combined with a handwriting font for a more personal touch.\nAdvanced Caching & Archiving: Investigate implementing a more robust hosting setup similar to gwern.net, potentially using a custom server or CDN rules to ensure long-term availability and performance of content and assets.\nFull-Text Search: Implement a client-side or serverless search function to allow users to search the full text of all blog posts and pages."

This would be a significant step towards a more academic and information-rich presentation, especially for research articles and would align the website more with the core ideas of Tufte.\nEvolve into a Digital Garden: Move beyond a traditional blog structure towards a network of interconnected notes. This involves:\n\nCreating a dedicated /garden section for evergreen notes, ideas, and summaries.\nPrioritizing bidirectional linking between pages to create a web of knowledge.\nWriting in a way that notes can be updated over time as understanding evolves.\nLeveraging Quarto’s built-in cross-referencing (@page-title) as a foundation and potentially exploring more advanced solutions for visualizing the network.\n\nIllustrated Manuscript Initials: Replace the CSS-based drop caps with a system that uses images of ornate, manuscript-style first letters. This could involve a small script to replace the first letter with an &lt;img&gt; tag pointing to a random initial from a collection. This could also be combined with a handwriting font for a more personal touch.\nAdvanced Caching & Archiving: Investigate implementing a more robust hosting setup similar to gwern.net, potentially using a custom server or CDN rules to ensure long-term availability and performance of content and assets.\nFull-Text Search: Implement a client-side or serverless search function to allow users to search the full text of all blog posts and pages."

    "section": "",
    "text": "3 figures, two clad in black band t-shirts, the third more formal, stand in between rows of server racks. The formal figure asks “So, besides uncapped job run time, what do you need?”. The t-shirt warriors pull down their sunglasses, share a sinister look and answer “Data. Lots of data.”\nThe foundation for any simulation study are data. I guess technically the data don’t have to be observations of some data-generating process (DGP) similar to what I have been using in bayesim so far. They could be any kind of artifact you’d like to simulate and do something with afterwards. But in a more general sense, even if you were to run a simulation study on images, sound or functions themselves, each individual instance would represent one data point.\nWriting a data-generating function itself is rather easy, maybe all you need is a simple rnorm() and you are done. The complicated part is to build an interface that supports all the extra wishes we might have in the context of our simulation study. Maybe we want a training and a testing data set. Maybe some parameters of the DGP are randomly drawn during the function call but we need them as reference values for later when we calculate the estimation bias for the metrics and so on. To allow others to write their own DGPs, I had to define some arguments and an output format that bayesim would expect while just asking the user to hand over the function as simply another argument.\nMy solution to this was to write a check function that not only tests a user`s function but also gives feedback if things are missing and how to fix them.\n\nInput arguments\nBesides the arguments that any data-generating function might need for itself, there are some optional arguments that depend on the kind of metric you might want to calculate on your models later on. Following along the currently supported metrics in the metric_lookup the first thing dependent on the DGP are reference values for some of the variable base metrics like bias and rmse. Luckily we already have the vars_of_interest argument that we plan to use during metric calculation that we can simply reuse as we would need reference values for all variables of interest anyway. For some of the predictive metrics we need test datasets, that the model hasn’t seen during fitting. While data generation will be a lot quicker than model fitting, I think it is good courtesy not to require additional testing data sets when they are not needed. A simple testing_data flag should be all that we need for this. Finally we need to be able to pass an rng seed to make the DGP reproducible.\nIn R, you can use the formals() function to get a list of the formal arguments of a function. Using this it is rather easy to test if a function accepts the arguments we just defined:\n\nmissing_dgp_args &lt;- function(fun){\n  required_args &lt;- c(\n    \"vars_of_interest\",\n    \"testing_data\",\n    \"seed\"\n  )\n  return(\n    required_args[\n      !(\n        required_args %in% names(formals(fun))\n      )\n    ]\n  )\n}\n\ngood_dpg &lt;- function(n, vars_of_interest, testing_data, seed) {\n  rep(1, n)\n}\n\nbad_dgp &lt;- function(n, vars_of_interest, testing_data) {\n  rep(1, n)\n}\n\nmissing_dgp_args(good_dpg)\n\ncharacter(0)\n\nmissing_dgp_args(bad_dgp)\n\n[1] \"seed\""

    "text": "A story I like to tell to showcase the welcoming atmosphere at coala is one about ramen. Some time last year I was talking with Asnel about how to improve a bowl of instant ramen until you get a healthy (and also very tasty) meal.  Because it was a rather quiet evening we did so in our main channel, when suddenly a wild newcomer appeared (I sadly don’t remember the name). While we helped him get started, we also continued our discussion on how adding some vegetables and a soft-boiled egg could make all the difference between a cheap snack and a fulfilling meal.\nLater that evening, the newcomer just found their way into our offtopic channel, they voiced their amazement about how we, “the gods of programming, the wise elders of this awesome open source project” could discuss such profanities as upgrading your ramen game. Surely we had more important, ground breaking, work to do. I am pretty sure those weren’t the exact words but the idea was the same. Even more amazing, the newcomer was able to participate (who has never eaten a bowl of instant ramen?) and contribute. The newcomer loved the casual atmosphere and being included, who would have guessed.\nThis taught me some things.\nIt was the last realization that made me embrace the “Secretary of Offtopic” title (which I gave to myself to be honest). Offtopic interaction seems to be something people love and it can connect complete strangers over something all sides know about.\nIn comes:"

Probably with more focus on the cooking and less focus on the competition. The goal after all lies on the fun of experimenting in the kitchen, trying out new meals and get becoming your own chef.\n\nThe Format\nAt this point I am not entirely sure how the format will go. We probably will do a 2 week run, where everyone can enter with a dish they cooked themselves and the recipe and then there will be a vote. I guess we’d invite the winner(s) to showcase their dish on the coala blog (maybe we can get our own category so we don’t spam it too hard) and maybe we can find someone crazy enough to get some form of prizes, who knows. As long as there are no real prizes involved, I don’t think any real rules will be written as the whole thing is just for fun and giggles.\n\n\nAny Timeline?\nJust to get rolling, the first round will start now and end in two weeks (April 29.). If you want to participate, just cook something, make nice pictures of the result (maybe also during the cooking part), write a blog post and get it onto the coala blog.\nUpdate: Create a PR to coala/recipes with your entry as a .md file and blog post format.\nThe first round will mostly be an idea finding time to figure out how we can organize this and how it is supposed to work. :)\nFinally, have fun cooking!"

    "text": "Teams in coala\nI had the idea for the teams around EuroPython 2016 as a way to take part of the organisatory burden from Lasse. At that time he was making almost all the meaningful decisions in coala, not because he wanted to, but because everyone asked him. This meant that Lasse had almost no time to do anything besides organization and management stuff. Considering that he is one of our more experienced developers that sounds like a waste of potential. Not to say that he wasn’t doing an awesome job managing everything, but maybe someone else could take on the management role and free some of Lasse’s time up for developing again. Thus the teams idea was born. Having team leaders that take over parts of the management burden associated with their team’s scope would leave Lasse more free time, add more voices and brains to decisions and diversify our “leadership rank”. In the end Monolythic management can only get you so far. If you want to read more about the structure of teams in coala you can take a look at the teams cEP"

Partly to create a mechanism of control for the rest of the coala community but mainly to give the teams a place and platform to talk about the awesome stuff they create and work on.\nThe first thing that I would claim for the community team would be the creation of the teams cEP, election for team leaders and all together the creation of the coala teams. While the cEP was written by me I had great reviewers. I wanted to list them here but looking at the PRs, that would be too many names. We had 7 leader applications for 6 teams and recently we added the review team with another Max as leader.\nAfter that Mariatta added the Code of Conduct which was lacking until then. This enabled Udayan to apply coala for the RGSoC, which just got accepted. YEAY!\nAfter that we finally got our call for participation out so all the coalians who want to become team members knew it was possible. We got a lot of applications and so far it looks promising.\nAnd finally Hemang and Kaisar wove their web-dev magic (dark arts if you ask me) and created not only a new landing page but also this awesome projects page. Although evil tongues claim the landing page was not only a community team effort I claim that all your page are belong to us.\nYou should definitely check out all the cool stuff created and give some love to the members of this awesome team."

This also keeps me available as a backup mentor if everything else fails and generally let’s me keep eyes on the hoard with less distraction.\n\nProjects Page\nSo I talked about the project page in the first post. Go visit projects.coala.io and see for yourself. It is absolutely gorgeous. Again designed by Hemang and deployed by Kaisar (our dev - ops dream team, praise be, praise be).\nAfter it was done, we had to fill it with projects. There was an old wiki page with rough idea outlines and as a starter, we mainly just copy-pasted the ideas over onto the new page. At FOSDEM we met Stephanie from Google and she really liked the page but told us, that the descriptions were meh for some projects. This lead to us rewriting ~20 project descriptions over two weeks. A lot of students that were already preparing for their applications helped with the new descriptions and reviews which probably helped them a lot with understanding the projects better.\nAlthough we received a lot of positive feedback for the projects page, we might not do it as in depth the next time. Although it helped students to understand the projects better, we feel like it also makes it harder for them to distinguish themselves in through the applications. It is hard to come up with your own solutions if you have a set path laid out in front of you. This is something for us to keep in mind and I bet that there will be a lot more of these ideas in the resume post of GSoC that surely will come."

    "text": "Members cEP and Updates to the Newcomer Guide\nThe rewrite is essentially done but blocked by the additions to the newcomer guide that need to happen. The main additions are rules about how to remove ranks/rights from members of the community. This is mainly needed due to the high number of inactive maintainers from our early days. I also clarified some of the thoughts and ideas behind the rights tied to the ranks, for example the idea that non code contributors could become maintainers.\nThe part that blocks the PR are the rules for becoming a developer. The newcomer guide is supposed to guide everyone to the point, where we consider them a part of our developing community no longer in the learning phase of basics. To make things easier, I combined this with a lot of changes I wanted to do to the guide and so the PR is now huge and will probably take another few weeks to get merged."

    "text": "Why the silence?\nBasically GSoC happened.\nI totally underestimated the amount of time the GSoC preparation would ask from me. Not only in a productive “I have to review 20 PRs a day to get the project descriptions right” way, but also in the “Are we missing anything? Could we do something better” mind hogging kind of way. The preparation of GSoC just took all of my awareness hostage and so it almost became the sole thing I did over the last months.\nThis also led to most people from the community team being entangled in the preparation. Hemang and Kaisar basically were on standby 24/7 just waiting for us to ask for the next addition or fix we desperately needed before some deadline, Lasse was part of the never sleeping admin team, Mariatta is now a python core dev and Udayan is working and researching. Basically we were all either working on GSoC or something outside of coala. I feel like I should add, that they all worked on coala a lot more than I did during the last few month. Probably.\nEssentially we all got eaten by GSoC and now that I have some breathing room again, I try to collect everyone to get rolling again."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I have a model fitted on data from 5 groups and want to plot the conditional effects for them. However, I don’t want one color per group but instead want to color them according to meta-groups. If I use the meta-group as an argument for the color and fill, I get the zigzag lines. group_by(group) also doesn’t help here. Instead we have to fiddle with the legend and the color map. Arrange the colors in the order we want them to be and, and this is the final trick needed, name the colors with their corresponding group. You also need a labeler to overwrite the actual groups in the legend later, but only for the things that will be in the breaks vector. my_colors_2 &lt;- c(‘#4477AA’, ‘#4477AA’, ‘#4477AA’, ‘#EE6677’, ‘#EE6677’)\nnames(my_colors_2) &lt;- c(“y ~ x + z1 + z2”, “y ~ x + z1”, “y ~ x + z1 + z2 + z3”, “y ~ x + z2”, “y ~ x + z1 + z2 + z4”)\nformula.labs &lt;- c(“Unbiased”, “Biased”) names(formula.labs) &lt;- c(“y ~ x + z1 + z2”, “y ~ x + z1 + z2 + z4”) You then plot your plot with the usual color and fill = formula as you would. Then, you mess with the scales/labels by adding the breaks argument. This only works with the named color map, as ggplot otherwise doesn’t seem to know how to color the formulas that are not part of the breaks vector scale_color_manual(values = my_colors_2, labels = formula.labs, breaks = c(“y ~ x + z1 + z2”, “y ~ x + z1 + z2 + z4”)) + scale_fill_manual(values = my_colors_2, labels = formula.labs, breaks = c(“y ~ x + z1 + z2”, “y ~ x + z1 + z2 + z4”))\nIf you want to collect guides below plots with patchwork, you can use & instead of + to add a theme element as such: (tpr + theme(axis.title.x = element_blank())) / fpr + theme(strip.text.x = element_blank()) + plot_layout(guides = ‘collect’) & theme(legend.position = “bottom”)\n\nlibrary(colorspace)\norange &lt;- hex2RGB(\"#D2691E\", gamma = FALSE)\norange_hcl &lt;- as(orange, \"polarLUV\")\n\norange_h &lt;- orange_hcl@coords[1, \"H\"]\norange_c &lt;- orange_hcl@coords[1, \"C\"]\norange_l &lt;- orange_hcl@coords[1, \"L\"]\n\n\nseq_60 &lt;- seq(from = -300, to = 300, by = 60)\norange_60 &lt;- seq_60 + orange_h\n\norange_h_lower &lt;- orange_60[which((orange_60 &gt;= 0 & orange_60 &lt; 60))]\norange_h_upper &lt;- orange_60[which((orange_60 &gt;= 300 & orange_60 &lt; 360))]\n\nhcl_six &lt;- qualitative_hcl(\n  6, \n  h = c(orange_h_lower, orange_h_upper), \n  c = orange_c, \n  l = orange_l\n)"
