    "text": "Teams in coala\nI had the idea for the teams around EuroPython 2016 as a way to take part of the organisatory burden from Lasse. At that time he was making almost all the meaningful decisions in coala, not because he wanted to, but because everyone asked him. This meant that Lasse had almost no time to do anything besides organization and management stuff. Considering that he is one of our more experienced developers that sounds like a waste of potential. Not to say that he wasn’t doing an awesome job managing everything, but maybe someone else could take on the management role and free some of Lasse’s time up for developing again. Thus the teams idea was born. Having team leaders that take over parts of the management burden associated with their team’s scope would leave Lasse more free time, add more voices and brains to decisions and diversify our “leadership rank”. In the end Monolythic management can only get you so far. If you want to read more about the structure of teams in coala you can take a look at the teams cEP"

Mariatta, yeay an imdb star!, who is interested in the wellbeing of the community and the newcomer experience, Hemang, our frontend guru, Kaisar the backend equivalent and Udayan who will work on administering RGSoC (besides being the Research team leader, awesome!).\nTogether we have many ideas on how to improve and grow a healthy community. Creating a welcoming environment where everyone feels welcome, a place where we can teach and learn from each other, a place where we can exchange mutual interests, a place to grow as professionals and humans."

    "text": "What we achieved so far\nThis section is part of a activity report we wanted to implement for all teams. Partly to create a mechanism of control for the rest of the coala community but mainly to give the teams a place and platform to talk about the awesome stuff they create and work on.\nThe first thing that I would claim for the community team would be the creation of the teams cEP, election for team leaders and all together the creation of the coala teams. While the cEP was written by me I had great reviewers. I wanted to list them here but looking at the PRs, that would be too many names. We had 7 leader applications for 6 teams and recently we added the review team with another Max as leader.\nAfter that Mariatta added the Code of Conduct which was lacking until then. This enabled Udayan to apply coala for the RGSoC, which just got accepted. YEAY!\nAfter that we finally got our call for participation out so all the coalians who want to become team members knew it was possible. We got a lot of applications and so far it looks promising.\nAnd finally Hemang and Kaisar wove their web-dev magic (dark arts if you ask me) and created not only a new landing page but also this awesome projects page. Although evil tongues claim the landing page was not only a community team effort I claim that all your page are belong to us.\nYou should definitely check out all the cool stuff created and give some love to the members of this awesome team."

Open source baby!) and we have some exciting projects and collaborations in the pipeline.\nBesides the huge GSoC effort, I am in the process of rewriting the members cEP, which includes some major changes to our newcomer guide and we are working on improving the communication for maintainers. Hopefully this will be the done until our next post.\nIf you have ideas, questions, comments or other input, visit us in our gitter channel or drop us an email under community at coala.io.\nUntil next time,\nYour Community Team"

    "text": "A story I like to tell to showcase the welcoming atmosphere at coala is one about ramen. Some time last year I was talking with Asnel about how to improve a bowl of instant ramen until you get a healthy (and also very tasty) meal.  Because it was a rather quiet evening we did so in our main channel, when suddenly a wild newcomer appeared (I sadly don’t remember the name). While we helped him get started, we also continued our discussion on how adding some vegetables and a soft-boiled egg could make all the difference between a cheap snack and a fulfilling meal.\nLater that evening, the newcomer just found their way into our offtopic channel, they voiced their amazement about how we, “the gods of programming, the wise elders of this awesome open source project” could discuss such profanities as upgrading your ramen game. Surely we had more important, ground breaking, work to do. I am pretty sure those weren’t the exact words but the idea was the same. Even more amazing, the newcomer was able to participate (who has never eaten a bowl of instant ramen?) and contribute. The newcomer loved the casual atmosphere and being included, who would have guessed.\nThis taught me some things.\nIt was the last realization that made me embrace the “Secretary of Offtopic” title (which I gave to myself to be honest). Offtopic interaction seems to be something people love and it can connect complete strangers over something all sides know about.\nIn comes:"

Probably with more focus on the cooking and less focus on the competition. The goal after all lies on the fun of experimenting in the kitchen, trying out new meals and get becoming your own chef.\n\nThe Format\nAt this point I am not entirely sure how the format will go. We probably will do a 2 week run, where everyone can enter with a dish they cooked themselves and the recipe and then there will be a vote. I guess we’d invite the winner(s) to showcase their dish on the coala blog (maybe we can get our own category so we don’t spam it too hard) and maybe we can find someone crazy enough to get some form of prizes, who knows. As long as there are no real prizes involved, I don’t think any real rules will be written as the whole thing is just for fun and giggles.\n\n\nAny Timeline?\nJust to get rolling, the first round will start now and end in two weeks (April 29.). If you want to participate, just cook something, make nice pictures of the result (maybe also during the cooking part), write a blog post and get it onto the coala blog.\nUpdate: Create a PR to coala/recipes with your entry as a .md file and blog post format.\nThe first round will mostly be an idea finding time to figure out how we can organize this and how it is supposed to work. :)\nFinally, have fun cooking!"

    "text": "GSoC 2017\nSo yea. coala is in. We are our own organization and might even serve as an umbrella for some smaller projects.\nHow awesome is that!?!\nWe received 54 applications and the average quality is very high compared to what other orgs get. At least that is what I hear from admins and mentors. We have 22 Mentors and three admins, two of whom would also be willing to mentor students.\n79 people who would like to GSoC at coala. Wow!\nI won’t mentor anyone as we feel like a designated admin with no student ties might be a good idea if any conflict come up. This also keeps me available as a backup mentor if everything else fails and generally let’s me keep eyes on the hoard with less distraction.\n\nProjects Page\nSo I talked about the project page in the first post. Go visit projects.coala.io and see for yourself. It is absolutely gorgeous. Again designed by Hemang and deployed by Kaisar (our dev - ops dream team, praise be, praise be).\nAfter it was done, we had to fill it with projects. There was an old wiki page with rough idea outlines and as a starter, we mainly just copy-pasted the ideas over onto the new page. At FOSDEM we met Stephanie from Google and she really liked the page but told us, that the descriptions were meh for some projects. This lead to us rewriting ~20 project descriptions over two weeks. A lot of students that were already preparing for their applications helped with the new descriptions and reviews which probably helped them a lot with understanding the projects better.\nAlthough we received a lot of positive feedback for the projects page, we might not do it as in depth the next time. Although it helped students to understand the projects better, we feel like it also makes it harder for them to distinguish themselves in through the applications. It is hard to come up with your own solutions if you have a set path laid out in front of you. This is something for us to keep in mind and I bet that there will be a lot more of these ideas in the resume post of GSoC that surely will come."

The main additions are rules about how to remove ranks/rights from members of the community. This is mainly needed due to the high number of inactive maintainers from our early days. I also clarified some of the thoughts and ideas behind the rights tied to the ranks, for example the idea that non code contributors could become maintainers.\nThe part that blocks the PR are the rules for becoming a developer. The newcomer guide is supposed to guide everyone to the point, where we consider them a part of our developing community no longer in the learning phase of basics. To make things easier, I combined this with a lot of changes I wanted to do to the guide and so the PR is now huge and will probably take another few weeks to get merged."

The preparation of GSoC just took all of my awareness hostage and so it almost became the sole thing I did over the last months.\nThis also led to most people from the community team being entangled in the preparation. Hemang and Kaisar basically were on standby 24/7 just waiting for us to ask for the next addition or fix we desperately needed before some deadline, Lasse was part of the never sleeping admin team, Mariatta is now a python core dev and Udayan is working and researching. Basically we were all either working on GSoC or something outside of coala. I feel like I should add, that they all worked on coala a lot more than I did during the last few month. Probably.\nEssentially we all got eaten by GSoC and now that I have some breathing room again, I try to collect everyone to get rolling again."
