# Performance Baseline Report

**Date**: July 20, 2025  
**Audit Tool**: Custom TypeScript Performance Auditor  
**Target**: 3-second page load time  

## Executive Summary

The performance baseline audit reveals that the current website **exceeds the 3-second performance target** with an average load time of **3.75 seconds**. This represents a **751ms gap** that needs to be addressed through optimization efforts.

## Current Performance Metrics

| Metric | Current Value | Target | Status |
|--------|---------------|--------|--------|
| Average Load Time | 3,751ms | 3,000ms | ‚ùå **Exceeds by 751ms** |
| Total Assets | 8 files | - | ‚úÖ Reasonable |
| Total Asset Size | 0.26MB | <0.5MB | ‚úÖ Good |
| Average Resources per Page | 34 | <50 | ‚úÖ Acceptable |

## Page-by-Page Breakdown

| Page | Load Time | Status | Priority |
|------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Homepage | 4,629ms | ‚ùå **Slowest** | High |
| Blog | 3,415ms | ‚ùå Over target | Medium |
| Research | 3,464ms | ‚ùå Over target | Medium |
| Projects | 3,496ms | ‚ùå Over target | Medium |

## Key Findings

### üî¥ Critical Issues
1. **Homepage Performance**: At 4.6 seconds, the homepage is significantly slower than other pages
2. **Universal Slowness**: All pages exceed the 3-second target
3. **Performance Gap**: 20-25% reduction needed across all pages

### üü° Optimization Opportunities
1. **Asset Optimization**: Current assets are reasonably sized but could be optimized
2. **Resource Count**: 34 resources per page suggests room for bundling/optimization
3. **Loading Strategy**: No evidence of lazy loading or critical path optimization

## Recommended Actions (Priority Order)

### 1. Homepage Optimization (High Priority)
- **Target**: Reduce homepage load time from 4.6s to <3s (35% reduction)
- **Focus**: Identify homepage-specific bottlenecks
- **Impact**: Highest user-facing improvement

### 2. Asset Optimization (High Priority)
- **SVG Optimization**: Use vecta.io/nano for SVG compression
- **Image Optimization**: Convert to WebP/AVIF formats
- **Font Optimization**: Implement font-display: swap and subsetting

### 3. CSS/JS Optimization (Medium Priority)
- **Critical CSS**: Inline above-the-fold styles
- **Non-critical CSS**: Defer loading
- **JavaScript**: Minify and bundle efficiently

### 4. Caching Strategy (Medium Priority)
- **Browser Caching**: Optimize cache headers
- **Service Worker**: Consider for offline functionality

## Performance Budget

Based on the baseline audit, the following performance budget has been established:

```json
{
  "timing": {
    "loadTime": 3000,
    "firstContentfulPaint": 1800,
    "largestContentfulPaint": 2500,
    "cumulativeLayoutShift": 0.1
  },
  "resources": {
    "total": 500,
    "images": 200,
    "scripts": 100,
    "stylesheets": 50,
    "fonts": 100
  }
}
```

## Success Metrics

- **Primary Goal**: Achieve <3s average load time (20% improvement)
- **Homepage Goal**: Reduce homepage to <3s (35% improvement)
- **Consistency Goal**: All pages within 10% of each other
- **User Experience**: Maintain manuscript aesthetic while improving performance

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Begin SVG and image optimization (Task 2.1, 2.3)
2. **Short-term**: Implement font loading optimization (Task 2.2)
3. **Medium-term**: Set up Lighthouse CI for regression testing (Task 1.2)
4. **Ongoing**: Monitor performance impact of each optimization

## Technical Implementation

The baseline audit system has been implemented using:
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe performance monitoring
- **Puppeteer**: Automated browser testing
- **Core Web Vitals**: Industry-standard metrics
- **Asset Analysis**: Comprehensive file system audit

This establishes a solid foundation for performance regression testing and continuous monitoring throughout the optimization process.
