## Bio

Welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm a researcher and developer passionate about data science, statistical computing, and the intersection of technology and human understanding.

When I'm not diving deep into code or exploring new methodologies, you might find me contemplating the slow web movement, appreciating thoughtful design, or working on projects that prioritize clarity and longevity over fleeting trends.

This site serves as my digital garden - a space for sharing research, thoughts, and the occasional personal reflection. It's built with intentionality, embracing principles of accessibility, privacy, and sustainable web practices.
