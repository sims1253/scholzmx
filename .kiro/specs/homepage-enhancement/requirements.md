# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing Quarto-based personal website (scholzmx.com) to add missing functionality, improve performance, and prepare it for production deployment. The enhancement focuses on implementing a "quote of the day" feature, optimizing page load times, potentially integrating modern CSS frameworks, and ensuring the site maintains its cozy, manuscript-inspired aesthetic while being robust enough for public release.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see an inspiring quote that changes daily, so that I have a reason to return and feel welcomed by thoughtful content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the website THEN the system SHALL display a randomly selected quote from a curated collection
2. WHEN the same user visits on the same day THEN the system SHALL show the same quote consistently throughout that day
3. WHEN a new day begins THEN the system SHALL automatically select a different quote for display
4. WHEN the quote is displayed THEN it SHALL be positioned in a visually appropriate location that complements the manuscript aesthetic
5. IF the quote collection is empty THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the absence without breaking the layout

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want the site to load quickly and perform well, so that visitors have a smooth experience and are more likely to engage with the content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loads any page THEN the initial page load time SHALL be under 3 seconds on a standard broadband connection
2. WHEN images are loaded THEN they SHALL be optimized for web delivery without compromising visual quality
3. WHEN JavaScript executes THEN it SHALL not block the rendering of critical content
4. WHEN CSS is loaded THEN it SHALL be minified and optimized for delivery
5. IF performance issues are identified THEN they SHALL be documented and addressed before deployment

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want to evaluate modern CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS or shadcn, so that I can improve code maintainability while preserving the unique aesthetic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating CSS frameworks THEN the assessment SHALL consider impact on the existing manuscript-inspired design
2. WHEN implementing framework changes THEN the visual aesthetic SHALL remain consistent with the design roadmap
3. WHEN framework integration occurs THEN it SHALL not increase bundle size significantly
4. IF a framework is adopted THEN existing custom styles SHALL be preserved or properly migrated
5. WHEN framework evaluation is complete THEN a decision SHALL be documented with reasoning

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want the site to be production-ready, so that I can confidently replace my current live website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the site is deployed THEN all pages SHALL render correctly across modern browsers
2. WHEN users navigate the site THEN all links SHALL work properly without broken references
3. WHEN the site is accessed on mobile devices THEN it SHALL be fully responsive and functional
4. WHEN search functionality is used THEN it SHALL work properly on both desktop and mobile
5. IF any critical bugs exist THEN they SHALL be identified and fixed before production deployment

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the quote feature to feel integrated with the site's medieval manuscript aesthetic, so that it enhances rather than disrupts the overall experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the quote is displayed THEN it SHALL use typography consistent with the manuscript theme
2. WHEN the quote appears THEN it SHALL be styled with appropriate decorative elements (borders, ornaments, etc.)
3. WHEN the quote is positioned THEN it SHALL not interfere with existing interactive elements
4. IF the quote is long THEN it SHALL wrap gracefully within its designated space
5. WHEN viewed on different screen sizes THEN the quote SHALL maintain its aesthetic appeal and readability

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see beautiful artwork that rotates periodically, so that I can discover and appreciate the artist's work while browsing the site.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the art slideshow displays an image THEN it SHALL show artwork from artandfun.net with proper attribution
2. WHEN a user clicks on the slideshow image THEN the system SHALL navigate to the specific artwork's page on artandfun.net
3. WHEN images rotate THEN they SHALL change periodically to showcase different pieces
4. WHEN images are loaded THEN they SHALL be optimized for web display while maintaining visual quality
5. IF the slideshow fails to load THEN it SHALL gracefully degrade without breaking the page layout

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an artist (the website owner's mother), I want my artwork to be properly credited and linked back to my portfolio, so that viewers can discover more of my work and potentially commission pieces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN artwork is displayed THEN it SHALL include visible attribution to the artist
2. WHEN users interact with the artwork THEN they SHALL be able to easily navigate to the full portfolio
3. WHEN artwork is sourced THEN it SHALL either link directly to artandfun.net images or use local copies with proper attribution
4. WHEN attribution is shown THEN it SHALL be styled consistently with the site's aesthetic
5. IF artwork fails to load THEN the attribution and link SHALL still be accessible
